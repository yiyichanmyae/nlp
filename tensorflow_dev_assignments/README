C3 - Course 3 of the Specialization
W1 - Week 1 of the Course

[C2_W2_Lab2_sarcasm_classifier.ipynb](C2_W2_Lab2_sarcasm_classifier.ipynb)- includes how GlobalAveragePooling1D() works and 
how hyperparameters like vocab size, padded sequences size, embedding dimensions can effect the confident of the predictions (based on loss),
visualization of the results based on model's history and how to check the embedding results from the embedding layers by using Tensorflow Embedding Projector.
